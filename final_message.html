        <p>Thank you so much for everything that you have done for me. It was because of your sacrifices and your strength that I am where I am today. Although we may have our differences, I am very grateful to have you as my mother.</p>
        <p>If I were given the chance to choose a mother, in all possibilities, I will always choose you. Because I am proud of you and even more proud to be your daughter.</p>
        <p>I love you very, very much. I miss you a lot every day. I may not say it as much, but I do. I pray that God watches over you and blesses you abundantly. You inspire me and make me strive for better.</p>
        <p><strong>A very happy birthday again!! ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’–</strong></p>
